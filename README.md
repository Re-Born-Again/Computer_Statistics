# Computer Statistics

Welcome to the Computer Statistics repository! T
his repository contains a variety of Jupyter notebooks covering key concepts in statistics, data analysis, and machine learning. 
The notebooks utilize Python libraries to demonstrate statistical methods and provide visualizations, making it a valuable resource for learners and practitioners alike.

## Descriptive Statistics and Visualizations

  - Box plot visualization of data distributions.
  - Heatmap visualization of correlation matrices.
  - Simple line plot for data visualization.
  - Scatter plot to explore relationships between variables.

## Statistical Tests

  - Performing the chi-square test for independence.
  - Conducting the t-test to compare means of two groups.
  - Fisherâ€™s exact test for small sample sizes.

## Regression Analysis

  - Performing simple linear regression.
  - Multi-variable linear regression analysis.
  - Simple linear regression with train-test split.
  - Calculating the root mean square error for regression models.

## Clustering

  - K-means clustering algorithm for unsupervised learning.
  - Single linkage clustering method for hierarchical clustering.

## Dimensionality Reduction

  - Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

## Data Files

  - Handling CSV data in Python.
  - Operations on matrices.
  - Working with data normalization techniques.

## Binary files

  - Binary data files for analysis.
